# rpi
Raspberry Pi Python Code </p>
My personal code created when learning to code with Python on Raspberry Pi

My notes
Place the work files in /home/pi/rpi/
this is the local repository
When a file is updated run 
git commit -F /home/pi/rpi/<file.py>
and then upload by running
git push origin master
(master is the name of the branch)
